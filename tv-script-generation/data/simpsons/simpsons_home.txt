Homer_Simpson: its at times like this i wish i were a religious man
Rev._Timothy_Lovejoy: its all over people we dont have a prayer
Kent_Brockman: and like icarus the rocket foolishly soared too high and lost control of its servo-guidance mechanism leaving us with some six hours to live so lets go live now to the charred remains of the only bridge out of town with arnie pye and arnie in the sky
Arnie_Pye: with the bridge gone and the airport unfortunately on the other side of the bridge a number of citizens are attempting to jump the gorge with their cars
Arnie_Pye: its a silent testament to the never give up and never think things out spirit of our citizens
Kent_Brockman: with our utter annihilation imminent our federal government has snapped into action we go live now via satellite to the floor of the united states congress
Lisa_Simpson: i cant believe that extra thick layer of pollution that ive actually picketed against is what burned up the comet
Bart_Simpson: whats really amazing is that this is exactly what dad said would happen

Evan_Conover: for some bizarre reason the aussies thought this would be a permanent thing of course it wasnt
Lisa_Simpson: i know those words but that sign makes no sense
Evan_Conover: anyway the down under fad fizzled and the diplomatic climate turned absolutely frosty
Evan_Conover: oops lets pretend we didnt see that
Evan_Conover: and barts childish taunting agitated the aussies further
Homer_Simpson: oh hell agitate ya ho ho he sure will what can we do for you
Evan_Conover: well its too late to merely pay back the money but as a sign of good faith to our australian friends wed like to imprison bart for five years
Homer_Simpson: thats tough but fair boy go with the man
Marge_Simpson: no no no no im not gonna have my son go to jail over some silly tiff with australia youll just have to find some other country to have relations with
Evan_Conover: youre sure now the prison train is sailing okay im not hearing a lot of support for prison there is one other option theyll drop the charges if bart makes a public apology in australia

Apu_Nahasapeemapetilon: thats nice although three of you are below voting age
Homer_Simpson: and im not registered
Apu_Nahasapeemapetilon: i do appreciate your concern really but it is hopeless the latest poll shows a whooping 85 support for proposition 24
Bart_Simpson: hey apu why dont just marry some american broad then dump her after you get your citizenship
Apu_Nahasapeemapetilon: oh listen it is hopeless poor apu
Grampa_Simpson: hey the government dont control the sky what if you lived in a balloon

Apu_Nahasapeemapetilon: seven years but i dont--
Lisa_Simpson: there was an amnesty declared for people whove been here as long as you that means you can take the citizenship test
Marge_Simpson: but apu the vote on proposition 24 is tuesday youll have to pass the test before then
Apu_Nahasapeemapetilon: oh no that is not nearly enough time to learn over 200 years of american history
Homer_Simpson: oh it cant be that many cmon apu ill be your tutor
Homer_Simpson: please identify this object
Apu_Nahasapeemapetilon: it appears to be the flag which disappeared from the public library last year
Homer_Simpson: correct now we all know the thirteen stripes are for good luck but why does the american flag have precisely 47 stars
Apu_Nahasapeemapetilon: because this particular flag is ridiculously out of date the library must have purchased it during the brief period in 1912 after new mexico became a state but before arizona did
Homer_Simpson: uh partial credit
Homer_Simpson: now they may ask you to locate your town on a map of the us so lets do that uh springfield springfield ah right here

Dr._Julius_Hibbert: a monstrous irregularity
Dr._Julius_Hibbert: yes i remember barts birth well you dont forget a thing like siamese twins
Lisa_Simpson: i believe they prefer to be called conjoined twins
Dr._Julius_Hibbert: and hillbillies prefer to be called sons of the soil but it aint gonna happen now normally the birth of siamese twins is a joyous occasion but unfortunately one of them was pure evil
Marge_Simpson: i think ill bottle-feed that one
Dr._Julius_Hibbert: a routine soul smear confirmed the presence of pure evil it was then i knew the only option was to separate you two immediately
Dr._Julius_Hibbert: youll both need to sign these
Dr._Julius_Hibbert: but what to do with poor hugo too crazy for boys town too much of a boy for crazy town the child was an outcast so we did the only humane thing
Homer_Simpson: we chained hugo up in the attic like an animal and fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week
Marge_Simpson: it saved our marriage
Bart_Simpson: you expect me to believe all this if any of it was true wouldnt i have a big hideous scar
Dr._Julius_Hibbert: weve got to find hugo

Dr._Julius_Hibbert: you know isnt it interesting how the left or sinister twin is invariably the evil one i had this theor wait a minute hugos scar is on the wrong side he couldnt have been the evil left twin that means the evil twin is and always has been bart
Bart_Simpson: oh dont look so shocked
Dr._Julius_Hibbert: well chalk this one up to carelessness on my part but i think theres a way to set everything right

Grampa_Simpson: finish her finish her
Lisa_Simpson: its true i read it on a place mat at a restaurant
Homer_Simpson: really a restaurant well now i dont know what to think
Homer_Simpson: and then he worked on a machine to communicate with the dead some kind of scary telephone i guess or maybe he planned to just stick his head under the ground and yell
Marge_Simpson: all right already everyone knows the man accomplished a lot maybe because he didnt spend every waking moment talking about thomas edison
Homer_Simpson: ohh thats where youre wrong marge he was a shameless self-promoter
Marge_Simpson: well youre not thomas edison
Homer_Simpson: marge thats it thats why i havent done anything with my life i need to be more like thomas edison
